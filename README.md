# Brain_Tumor_Detection

This repository contains a deep learning approach for detecting brain tumors from MRI images. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was designed and trained from scratch, alongside experiments with the pretrained InceptionV3 model using transfer learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to classify MRI scans accurately into categories representing the presence or absence of a brain tumor. The project compares the effectiveness of:

A CNN model built and trained from scratch.

Fine-tuned pretrained model: InceptionV3.

## Dataset

The models were trained and evaluated on a publicly available MRI dataset consisting of labeled images for brain tumor classification.
